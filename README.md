# Competitive Programming Explanations 🚀

Welcome to my repository! This is a growing collection of **detailed explanations**, **multiple solution strategies**, and **code implementations** for common problems encountered in **Competitive Programming** (CP).

I break down each problem with:
- Intuitive thought process 🧠
- Multiple approaches (from brute-force to optimal) 📊
- Time & Space complexity analysis ⏱️
- Well-commented C++ code snippets 💻
